A History of the Genre
1895-1938
The genre is not born with a single film although many films are claimed to be the so-called firsts from D. W. Griffith’s The Avenging Conscience (1914) as the Americans first great American film to Der Student von Prag/ The Student of Prague (1913) and the Edison Studios adaptation of Frankenstein (1910). Another reason this is almost impossible to say that these films were not considered to be know as horror film as this Genre was not even created by then. Other ways to trace this is to tradition of phantasmagoria, arrival of train in Lumiers films, trick films of George Melies especially his Le Manoir du Diable (1896). The Melies films admittedly uses satanic develish images but it can be traced back to his "anti-cleric sensibilities" and his aim to amuse and entertain than to arouse horror. But however we read him one thing is essential, the boundary where horror and fantasy are divided.

Experimental Stage - Generification
Thomas Schatz' concept of "experimental stage" formulates early moments of generic conventions at the moment when they were not established as such (9). In this sense, that is in retrospect we can talk of horror cinema in the early history of the medium. Instead talking of the first moments of the Genre we need to talk of a process, of becoming, of generification, that is how did the phenomenon, horror genre, emerged (9).
One bold line in this generification is German expressionism with anti-realist, distorted and nightmarish aesthetics, "privileging of anti-realism and the graphic depictions of inner states, and is replete with relevant Weimar themes of paralysed masculinity, industrialization and modernity, death and mourning, enforced conformity and madness (Kaes 2009).The immigration of these filmmakers to Hollywood had influence on American film of 1930s. 

The author examines the development of horror in American silent cinema, focusing on the figure of Lon Chaney, ‘The Man of a Thousand Faces’, who starred in films such as The Phantom of the Opera (1925) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), playing disfigured and monstrous characters. The author also mentions the cycle of horror-comedy films based on Broadway plays, such as The Cat and the Canary (1927), which featured a mix of chills and laughs in a spooky setting.

The so called golden age of Universal horror, when the genre cemented in style and popularity, is loosely simultaneous with the great depression, 1929 to late 1930s. It is also during this period that exploitation films and zombie films started to emerge. After five glorious years, the studios put an end to their line of horror production. One reason suggested was a decline in the British market due to a ban in Britain. But it is more accurate to say that the establishment of Production Code Administration (PCA) in 1934 (and also the sale of Universal studio). Late in the decade there came a revival with universal releasing ad Dracula Frankenstein spinoff and PCA moved from censoring sex and violence to political matters. Interestingly the rerelease of Frankenestein this time had two points of censcor. The first is the line of doctor saying how it feels to be like god. The other is the scene where the monster kills the daughter. Later when the child is found dead, the audience have no visual background of what have happened making it hypothetical that the child was molested by the monster. 

1939-1973
Crisis of Rationality

World War I: July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918.
World War II: September 1, 1939, to September 2, 1945.

During and after the Second World War, films largely avoided horror themes, favoring positive portrayals of the afterlife in a genre known as ‘film blanc’. An exception was “The Uninvited” (1944), a rare serious haunted house film of the time, which incorporated elements of romance and comedy alongside its horror themes.

One line that somehow escaped this narrative of decline was the line of horror production by RKO under the supervision of Val Lewton. With the strict production rules (less than 150,000 and under 75 minutes) and authorial tendency, Lewton changed the taste of horror films. *Cat People*, for instance, takes the setting into the well-known locales of New York. Jacques Turner treated the generic elements with artistic touch of film noir (low key cinematography) and delved deeper into darker psychology of characters.

Scientific Horror
After another hiatus in the late 1940s, the genre rose again in the form of monster movies and science fiction. We can think of it as classical monsters being scientifically preconceived and rendered. Films start showing paranoia and the distress of scientific progress. Gojira, presents a monster awaken by nuclear tests is eradicated by weapons of mass destruction and military interventions.

**B-Movies**
The line of B-movies more independent horror movies reached its peak by William Castle whose collaboration with Vincent Price and Castles's gimmicky presentations inspired many contemporaries (Hitchcock) and later horror filmmakers.

One reason why newer generation found inspiration of horror genre was that Universal sold packages of horror films to Tv station the first in (1957). In this period was Roger Corman the prolific film producer and horror filmmaker who became the godfather of many new-wave american filmmakers.

Meanwhile in Britain
Interestingly it was in Britain that Frankenestein and Dracula were adapted differently, presenting films that were more open to Graphic violence (Hammer Film Productions). Alongside the blood, another important element of Hammer’s brand was sexuality. The heaving bosoms of the early films eventually became copious amounts of nudity, especially in the early 1970s, when some Hammer’s films began to resemble soft pornography. This is especially true of the Karnstein trilogy of The Vampire Lovers (1971), Lust for a Vampire (1971) and Twins of Evil (1971).

Following the success of Hammer, Anglo-Amalgamated Productions distributed a short cycle of horror films, notably Horrors of the Black Museum (1959), Peeping Tom (1960), and Circus of Horrors (1960). These films, linked together as a loose ‘Sadian Trilogy’ by David Pirie, explored themes of sexualized violence and torture, contrasting with the supernatural themes favored by Hammer. One standout scene from Horrors of the Black Museum features a woman’s eyes being impaled by knives hidden in a pair of binoculars. The plotline, which involves a crime journalist committing crimes to report on them, offers an intriguing commentary on the public’s appetite for blood and depravity.

British ‘quality horror’ films, such as “The Innocents” (1961) and “The Haunting” (1963), which were known for their highbrow literary credentials, serious tone, and black-and-white cinematography. These films were seen as successors to the Lewton tradition of subtlety and suggestion, but received mixed reviews. “The Wicker Man” (1973) is highlighted as a cult favorite and a major work of British horror. The film, which reflects the cultural interest in occultism and paganism, centers around a Christian policeman investigating a missing girl on a remote island of neopagans. The film reveals its horror elements only at the end and has a clear anti-authoritarian bent.

Meanwhile in the Continent
The surrealist-influenced Franju mixes beauty with horror, in a film replete with echoes of both Nazi experiments and the institutionalized torture enacted by the French government in Algeria (Lowenstein 2005, 17–53); it is a paradigmatic example of the art film–horror hybrid (Hawkins 2000, esp. 65–85). 
MArio Bava's Black Sunday was full of beauty and graphic violence; cut by three minutes in the US and rejected downright in the UK. Bava is celebrated as an early master of the Italian horror/ mystery subgenre labelled ‘giallo’. 

1968 onwards (Secure vs. Paranoid Horror Film)
The text explores how horror films changed from a ‘secure’ to a ‘paranoid’ perspective in the 1960s and 1970s, based on the theory of Andrew Tudor. He argues that ‘secure’ horror films depict a world where human rationality and action can defeat the evil forces, while ‘paranoid’ horror films portray a world where the evil forces are beyond human control and often emerge from within humans themselves. The text gives two examples of ‘paranoid’ horror films that had a significant impact on the genre: Night of the Living Dead and Rosemary’s Baby, which inspired a new wave of low-budget horror filmmakers.


The case of The Genre
Genre, broadly defined, is a set of similar characteristics: formal, thematic, stylistic  that categorize a group of films under one name. These defining characteristics can be the local (jungle films, wester, war films), the feelings they produce (thriller, ‘weepy’ melodrama, ‘gross out’ comedy, erotic film), by audience (children film, women's picture) and so on.
Convention is the key to understand the iea of the genre, yet we have to be aware that these conventions are not vital to the films but typical (92 - 93). 

The concept of genre evolution, particularly in the context of film genres. by referencing to Thomas Schatz's theory, which outlines a four-stage process of genre development:

1. **Experimental Stage**: In this initial phase, the genre is not fully aware of itself. Films in this category are exploring new ideas without a set of established norms or conventions.
    
2. **Classical Stage**: Here, the genre achieves a sort of equilibrium. Both audiences and filmmakers have a clear understanding of the genre's conventions, leading to a stable and recognizable style.
    
3. **Refinement Stage**: This stage is marked by increased stylistic experimentation. Filmmakers start to reflect more on the ideological underpinnings of the genre, exploring and expanding its boundaries.
    
4. **Baroque Stage**: In the final stage, the stylistic elements introduced in the refinement stage become more dominant. The embellishments and stylistic aspects become central to the genre, sometimes overshadowing the original essence.
    
While Schatz's model is useful in highlighting the consistency and adaptability of film genres, it has limitations. One such limitation is the sense of predetermination it implies, suggesting an inevitable progression from an undefined genre to one that is overly stylized or 'baroque'. Additionally, this model might lead to a selective interpretation of genre history, where films fitting this narrative are emphasized or 'canonized', while others that do not align as closely are overlooked. This critique points to the complexity of genre evolution and the challenges in categorizing films within rigid stages. (93)

The passage summarizes Rick Altman's semantic/syntactic approach to film genres, which offers a framework for understanding genre conventions using concepts from linguistics:
1. **Semantic Elements**: These are akin to words or phonemes in linguistics. In the context of film genres, semantic elements include specific, identifiable features such as stock character types, conventional settings, props, and familiar musical cues. These elements are the basic building blocks of a genre.
    
2. **Syntactic Elements**: These are comparable to grammar in linguistics. Syntactic elements in film genres refer to structural aspects, including character relationships and formulaic plots. They dictate how the semantic elements are organized and interact to form a coherent narrative.
    
3. **Building Blocks and Structure**: Altman's analogy suggests that semantic elements are the components that make up a genre (like bricks in a building), while syntactic elements are the ways in which these components are arranged to create structure and meaning (like the design of the building).
    
4. **Cultural Meaning**: Altman argues that cultural meaning within a genre is primarily located in its syntactic elements, although it's noted that this meaning can be temporary and subject to change.
    
5. **Analyzing Genres**: To thoroughly understand a film genre, one must consider both its semantic and syntactic elements. For example, in analyzing a Western, one could look at semantic elements like cowboys and saloons and syntactic elements like the narrative structure of a stranger coming to town leading to a shootout.

This approach emphasizes the complexity of film genres, suggesting that a full understanding requires examining both the tangible elements and the underlying structural patterns.

[[Robin Wood Monster normality abnormality]]


Noël Carroll proposes a concept called 'art-horrified,' which refers to the feeling of horror experienced from art, rather than real life. To be 'art-horrified' by a fictional monster like Dracula involves three main conditions:

1. **Abnormal Physical Agitation**: Experiencing a state of physical unease or agitation that is unusual or intense.
    
2. **Thoughts Causing Agitation**: This agitation is caused by specific thoughts: a. Believing that Dracula, or a similar being, could possibly exist. b. Recognizing that Dracula is portrayed as physically (and perhaps morally and socially) threatening in the story. c. Considering Dracula to be 'impure' or fundamentally corrupt.
    
3. **Desire to Avoid**: These thoughts and feelings are often accompanied by a strong desire to avoid any contact with beings like Dracula.
    

Carroll's formula focuses on the psychological and emotional responses elicited by horror elements in art, rather than the genre of horror itself.

Wood’s account, to use Altman’s terminology, is more syntactic, since it depends on a broadly defined and infinitely adaptable set of relationships, whereas Carroll’s is more semantic, describing the characteristics that a monster must possess. Yet for all their differences, Wood and Carroll agree on something fundamental: the presence of the monster as a definitional feature of a horror film. ([[HorFcr]]96)

The whole attempt to find character X to define a genre is problematic and fading away over time. Now the focus is more on sub-genre, or specific elements (like dracula, monster), filmmakers, regions, etc., rather than the big baggy term of Horror.

//it reminds of the problem of Comic defenition and most importantly how it as fixed: a minimal defenition that is as inclusive as possible. I have to check it again. But if we relinquish it to common understanding how would I include Farhadi's film as embodying monstrosity. Do I consider to be the defining agent even if no other person readily accepts my position?//

Core and Margins
The "Cores and Margins" theory of genre suggests understanding genres through a core/periphery model. In this model, certain works are considered 'central' to a genre, creating a prototype effect (Bordwell 1989, 148). This approach explains the diversity within a genre and how multiple genres can intersect. For example, a film like "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" (1954) is both a Western and a musical but is closer to the core of the musical genre than the Western, despite its frontier setting being integral to the narrative. Just like in a Fuzzy set the core is more important than the margins.

The theory compares to Brian Attebery's concept in "The Strategies of Fantasy" (1992), where he describes fantasy as a 'fuzzy set' centered around a key work, like Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings." This central work serves as a mental template for the genre, not necessarily because it's the greatest or first of its kind, but because it's the most typical or recognized representation of the genre at the time. This model emphasizes the idea that genres are defined more by their central, defining works than by their outer boundaries.

this is funny, while we are trying to dissesct the movie studios are all about digest:
According to Altman, while critics have tended to prefer clear-cut generic labels, the film industry has tended in the opposite direction. From the perspective of the film studios, any film having multiple genres is desirable insofar as it can be sold several different ways to several different audiences. Titanic (1997) is an excellent case in point: a disaster movie that is also a historical romance, it successfully attracted viewers from a variety of different demographics and became a cultural event that seemingly no one, male or female, old or young, could possibly ignore. (99)

Chapter five
Mind and Body: The ‘Why?’ of Horror



#psychoanalysis_and_horror

//if we think of horror as a realm to unleash our deepest fears, securely, then it reminds me of Barbara Creed's idea that the monstrous feminine is only to be tamed; the whole horror narrative is a conservative device a safety valve to keep the normalcy being safe.//

"It is striking how often psychiatry is undermined in a genre with such heavily psychiatric roots. Yet many have argued that horror’s relationship to psychoanalysis goes deeper than content or even influence: that horror is the psychoanalytic genre par excellence, that it is not only amenable to being read through psychoanalysis, but does the work of psychoanalysis in plumbing and potentially purging the deepest and darkest recesses of our unconscious minds." (119)

Abjection
What is it? (126)

The ‘abject’ can be anything that troubles the lines between subjectivity and objectivity, between self and the world. Writes Kristeva, the abject is ‘the place where “I” am not, the place where meaning collapses’ (22). She associates it with urine and faeces (which start with self but become other), food (which does the opposite), sex, and the ultimate figure of abjection: the corpse: ‘If dung signifies the other side of the border, the place where I am not and which permits me to be, the corpse, the most sickening of wastes, is a border that has encroached upon everything. It is no longer I who expel, “I” is expelled’ (4). The abject is horrifying, but it is also fascinating, precisely because it fails to respect ‘borders, positions, rules’ (ibid.).

How is horror genre understood in the light of abjection?
It has been suggested that horror films act as ‘a kind of modern defilement rite in which all that threatens the symbolic, all that is of the Other, is separated out and subordinated to the paternal law’ (Grant 2004, 179) – an innately conservative process that serves to perpetuate the patriarchal status quo. (126).
Barbara Creed suggests that horror films are abject in three ways. They firstly show abject substances (corpse, blood, vomit), secondly, the monsters themselves are abject figures being situated on and crossing back and forth the borders of good and evil, human, inhuman, alive and dead, male and female. Thirdly and most importantly the horro deals with the mother who is the earliest point of abjection while to form subjectivity we need to push the mother away.

why is female body abject?

Because we have to push the mother away to build subjectivity and this is why wome’n body is abject. Female monsters always have something to do with reproductive functions.

"the central ideological project of the popular horror film [is] purification of the abject through a descent into the foundations of the symbolic construct. The horror film attempts to bring about a confrontation with the abject (the corpse, bodily wastes, the monstrous feminine) in order finally to eject the abject and redraw the boundaries between the human and non-human. As a modern form of defilement rite, the horror film attempts to separate out the symbolic order from all that threatens its stability, particularly the mother and all that her universe signifies. (14)"

Three names that contributed greatly to feminist horror film theory are Barbara Creed, Carol Clover, and Linda Williams.


Sound in Horror Films

Silent directors used superimposition to suggest sound. "Notably, in Strike (1925), Sergei Eisenstein superimposed an accordion over an early sequence to develop a sense of musicality (80). Paul Leni tried something similar in The Cat and the Canary, using superimpositions to represent someone knocking at a door and the chiming of a clock (Natale 2015, 70)." 

Ghost and apparitions in photography were depicted through superimposition. 
And is it not the same with sound? Is sound not simultaneously present and absent from the image, much the same as a superimposition? As Salomé Voegelin writes,

Sounds are like ghosts. They slink around the visual object, moving in on it from all directions, forming its contours and content in a formless breeze. The spectre of sound unsettles the idea of visual stability and involves us as listeners in the production of an invisible world. (12)1

Technological uncanny refers to the sense of uncertainty to a technology when it newly arrives. A famous example is that of Parisians being shocked by arrival of the train towards them on the screen. It seems that this sense of uncanniness vanishes as audience are familiarized with the medium. However, this uncanniness is essentially there and can be exploited by filmmakers.

The ventriloquism is an example to manifest technological uncanny in the cinema as all sounds in films seem to be ventriliqual.

Silence
In 1920, German critic Carlo Mierenoff wrote, ‘When the [live] music stops, things become frightening, ghostly, eerie’
Silence was made possible through introduction of sound to film.

Jump Scene
the first reportedly in Cat People. Murray talks of assualtive sound rather than startle effect as it is not louad all the tiem

Entity noise
Ghost noise from *Supernatural*
The idea of a bang or noise being unfamiliar but eventually the source being understod

This chapter ends with The Entity in part because the film makes a superlatively assaultive use of sound throughout, with the Entity noise calculated as an attack on the audience paralleling the attacks on Carla. It also solidifies many of the themes of this chapter, including the use of an exaggeratedly artificial sound to signify the presence of supernatural beings, the effective alternation of silence and volume and the lack of synchronization of sound and image as a source of uncanny effects. In fact, a provocative, unpleasant subtext of The Entity involves domestic violence: an ‘invisible’ offence performed by a controlling figure within the house, which Carla finds it difficult to convince people happened at all. The Entity represents the sonic half of the metaphysical marriage of sound and image as an abusive spouse who, while appeased to a degree, is never fully stopped – any more than the uncanny potential of sound is ever fully contained by its domestication in cinema. (183)


Horror Color
It was in 1965 that finally a standard film was supposed to be color and black and white was an artistic choice.
In Theater the use of colored light was common to denote supernatural especially blue and green.
195 - 196 - red as the color of horror through out cinema. "Two years earlier, Martin Scorsese desaturated the colour of the fake blood in Taxi Driver (1976) in order to avoid an X-rating (Wickman 2015, n.p.), and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) reputedly made Klingon blood pinkish-purple, which it has never been before or since, in order to avoid an R-rating."

"Needless to say, few horror films actualize the possibilities of colour quite as fully as Suspiria, and many go in the opposite direction. As Cameron notes of contemporary horror films, ‘a certain gritty, desaturated look has become a reliable template for films in the genre’ (87), downplaying colour’s impact in a way that moves against the baroque colours of Argento, Corman or even Castle."

Digital Horror 

It perhaps started by Mumler, the idea that one can record supernatural activities using modern technology just like modern devices that can magnify microscopic elements or radio that can transmit messages.

The films or videos showing these follow some codes like first person hand held- cheap home cameras grainy quality, something far from any efforts to be perfect.

Long take has been more viable for digital cinema, and horror, too, employs it to fix audience attention on the minor changes on the surface of the image.

Digital Uncanny
Terry Castle refers to the invention of uncanny. The 18th century which saw a cultural and intellectual transformation known as enlightenment, also created its side effect a new human experience of strangeness, anxiety, bafflement, and intellectual impasse’ (125). She follows this in the idea of Phantasmagoria. While in the beginning phantasmagoria was a projection of ghost-filled images, gradually these ghost and monstrous figures came to reside in our minds. The experience of uncanny, according to Castle is the consequence of this transformation.

Béla Balázs' account of a farm girl tell us how cultural training or lack of it might make just any film horrifying. The girls (mis)understanding of the film conventions horrifies her to see heads framed in a shot without the res of the body. This tale is not unlike the famous one told about Parisians who saw Lumiers' (in)famous arrival of the train. Laura Mulvey frame these kind of encounters under the term technological uncanny: ‘the sense of uncertainty and disorientation which has always accompanied a new technology that is not yet fully understood’ (160-161) (in Mulvey 27)
The cinema is also uncanny in a sense that it reproduces double images of the world but also because it is in the sate between animate and inanimate.
The familiarity with the medium diminishes this sense reinforced by film practice intention to minimize it and make world of films real and life-like. However, just like Freud's uncanny that resides in the texture of reality waiting to come to the fore, the uncanny in cinema is a also a potential that can be exploited by film makers (//but why not by the audience??//)
The split of sound and image, voice and body, and ventriliquism are among various instances of uncanny in horror films.
//Mulvey is building on Lev Manovich’s 2001 book The Language of New Media//

221-222: The J-horror tradition takes the idea of the dead or undead to the media, vhs and internet as if the undead are pouring out from the media and come back as data. It seems that the internet as a new technology, just like Mumler's photo

224-
Glitch is a modern kind of photogrpahical mistakes that had produced accidental ghostly appearances. Although we have examples of glithc in non horror films (Godard's Socialisme), it is horror that have exploited it extensively.
